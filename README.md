# responsiveNavbar

This is a responsive webpage with a navigation bar. At 1125px > pixels nav bar automatically gets hidden. And can be accessed using menu hamburger icon. Interesting about this nav bar is that when clicked on the humberger icon the menu bar does not cover the main part of the body, neither it pushes the content of the screen. The content just reshapes by decreasing the width.
